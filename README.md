<h2 align="left">I'm basically a mechanical engineer. In the course of my work so far, I have found my place in many fields, I have held various positions, I have always looked for something that is exciting, new, and moves me!<br>Don't put me in an account, I'll hang out. "New is always better!" I follow a principle, I didn't choose it, but that's how life has always taken me, and I let myself go with the flow.<br>I confess that nothing is impossible, only powerless. Over forty, I decided to improve - this is also my childhood dream - that's why I'm here now.</h2>
