This is my first Python project. Its a simple game based on the Zingo board game in Hungarian language. The rules are simple: there are 72 small cards in a dealer machine. There are 6 different player boards with two sides: red and green. You can choose wich one is preferred (red is a little bit more challanged). On the player boards there are 9 different card patterns - they are the same as the small cards. The dealer machine deals two small cards at the same time. All the players has to check is there any missing card and it is they need to press their own caller buttons (left and right). The first player to collect all their cards wins.
